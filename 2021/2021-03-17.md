### git

to see a merge difference between was incoming and was in current index tree
has the `git show` trick:

```shell
# make the commom ancestor file
git show :1:file > file.commom

# make the ours modification file
git show :2:file > file.ours

# make the incoming modification file
git show :3:file > file.theirs
```

to make a unified file with tree way handshake has:

```shell
git merge-file -p file.uors file.commom file.theirs > file
```
