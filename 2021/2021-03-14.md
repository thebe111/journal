### xxd

describe how a program as interpreted on operational system - bynary mode

### file descriptors

- describe if a file was open in `stdin(0)`, `stdout(1)`, `stderr(2)` mode and
how many files a process can open

**obs:** on linux i can visualize what descriptor are used for a process
on: `/proc/PID/fd/`

- `ulimit -n`: shows how many file can be opened on a process

### git

`git merge-base`: find the best ancestors commit and return the hash of the
commit

`git archive`: make a tarball of a project to distribution

```shell

git archive master --prefix="project/" | gzip $(git describe
master).tar.gz
```

**obs:** need a tag to `git describe <branch>` works
